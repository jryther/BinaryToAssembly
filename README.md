# BinaryToAssembly

**Overview**

In Modules One and Two, you practiced converting code between C++ and assembly. You also learned some of the attributes of assembly and examined how to access and view binary code. In this activity, you will take the next step by performing a task central to Project One, which is due in Module Five. The coding for this assignment will be performed in Codio. You will convert a series of four binary files to assembly and explain the functionality. You will submit the completed Binary to Assembly Activity Template Word Document. The following resources will help you complete the tasks in this assignment:

Section 6: Working With Binary Files in the Guide to Software Reverse Engineering
Section 9: Using the Bless Hex Editor in the Codio Guide

**Prompt**
For this activity, you will analyze four binary files. For each binary file, you must address the following rubric criteria:

List the binary file name.
Use the Binary to Assembly Activity Template to complete this step.
These files can be found in the Software Reverse Engineering Playground in the Module Three file folder in Codio.
Identify the functions in the binary file.
Use the Binary to Assembly Activity Template to complete this step.
Use the Bless Hex Editor on the Virtual Desktop to identify the functions.
List the identified function names for each binary file.
Convert the binary file to assembly code.
Decompile the binary file found in the Software Reverse Engineering Playground in the Module Three file folder in Codio.
Align the blocks of assembly code with their corresponding function in the binary file.
Use the Binary to Assembly Activity Template to complete this step.
Explain the functionality of the blocks of assembly code.
Use the Binary to Assembly Activity Template to complete this step.
